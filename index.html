  <h1 class="page-heading">Hi, I'm Josh.</h1>
  <p>You could say I'm a typical milennial. I get distracted easily. I went to a liberal arts college and majored in a useless field. I waste my life away on the Internet.</p>
  <p>You <em>could</em> say that. But that's only part of the story. My distractibility led me to learn how to leverage technology to create rich web experiences. My useless degree gave me the skills and confidence to start a theater company, acting and directing in America's hottest theater scene. What some see as a waste of time has actually made my life awesome.</p>
  <p>I'd like to help make your life awesome. If you have a website you need made, a play you need directed, or a performer for your project, <a href="http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/d?k=01ZB81xNNx2hQqJBevdGuUxQ==&amp;c=Fd7A5sjv-cs2Rq3QGLbcZcYHZ9xkxLxcGf8J0Fr_MbE=" onclick="window.open('http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/d?k\07501ZB81xNNx2hQqJBevdGuUxQ\75\75\46c\75Fd7A5sjv-cs2Rq3QGLbcZcYHZ9xkxLxcGf8J0Fr_MbE\075', '', 'toolbar=0,scrollbars=0,location=0,statusbar=0,menubar=0,resizable=0,width=500,height=300'); return false;" title="Reveal this e-mail address">drop me a line</a>.
