  description: I was hired to create a website for the first American tour of Chopin Without Piano, a play by Polish theater company CENTRALA. This production was supported by major arts grants. My website was intended both to sell tickets and to become an English-language hub for the production. Special attention was given to Lost Pianos, a viral marketing campaign for the production. I was the sole developer on the project, but I collaborated with marketing and content specialists throughout the process to create the ultimate experience.

  description: I was hired to complete a full redesign of the existing W. H. Cooke site, which at the time was little more than a few descriptive paragrahps and a contact page. I worked remotely to complete this responsive, standards-based redesign and to add much more content to the site. The appearance of the redesign and the content were handled by the company with my feedback. Additionally, I integrated an eCommerce solution using Authorize.Net as the payment gateway to accept client payments for goods. I created and edited documents and graphics when necessary, including launching a quarterly newsletter sent to thousands of subscribers and customers. I performed a holistic SEO analysis, keeping optimization at the forefront of my design. Over a 7 month period, my redesign increased the number of Sessions by 97% and the reduced the Bounce Rate by 19% (Google Analytics).

  description: I founded [redacted] Theater Company in early 2014, and when we were finally ready to launch publicly, I created the website. The censoring effect found throughout is raw CSS/JavaScript, not a plugin. I'm particularly proud of that effect, as I designed and developed the site by myself and am personally repsonsible for most of the content.

  description: After creating the first version of my personal website, I sought freelance clients. Fellow freelancer Mitchell Kyd, who is based in my hometown, trusted me to make her a website to serve as a professional hub. I used the front-end framework ZURB Foundation and created a basic CMS written in PHP to power the blog and other dynamically-generated content sections. I was also responsible for the design of the website.
